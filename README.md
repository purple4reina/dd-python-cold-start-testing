# dd-python-cold-start-testing

A simple test app with dashboard for performing before/after comparisons of dd-trace-py changes

This guide will walk you through creating lambda layers with unpublished
versions of dd-trace-py and datadog-lambda-python. You will then deploy two
lambda functions you wish to compare and execute them. Lastly, you'll be able
to view results in a custom dashboard.
